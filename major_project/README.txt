Instructions and Notes:
    The big button at the top opens the map.
    On the map you can select multiple countries by holding shift, or one at
    a time if you don't hold shift (See note at the bottom of the window). This
    is just a design choice to make it so that you don't have to open the window
    multiple times.
    After selecting countries and closing the map, it can take ~3 seconds for
    the list items to appear.
    The Send Report button will only send a report if it is valid (two currencies
    selected and a value inputted), you don't have to press calculate though for
    it to be valid.
    The 'To' phone number is taken from environment variables, this would be easy
    to change in future submissions though.
    Reports take ~5-10 seconds to appear on your phone.
