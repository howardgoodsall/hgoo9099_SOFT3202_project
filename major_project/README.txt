Instructions and Notes:
 - For the Personalisation  and User accounts feature:
    - Light/Dark mode persistent when logging out and back in.
    - Currencies in viewing table are also persistent.
    - Background colour of the map can be chosen (and is persistent).

 - Changes from Milestone 2 to Milestone 2 resubmission:
    - Javadoc added to the interfaces in the model.
    - UI changes including more space between buttons, rounded edges on buttons
      & changed text for the cache hit window.
    - MVC was partially implemented before, it has been completely removed now.
    - New classes in view have been added to break up some of the functionality
      of CurrencyView, so it is no longer a god class.
    - No changes to code in model, so no changes to test suite.
